# 💸 The Financial Breakdown

**The Financial Breakdown** is a set of simple, spreadsheet-style personal finance tools built with Streamlit.

It started as an Excel spreadsheet I made for myself when I realized I technically *had* money but didn’t really know where it was going or what it all looked like together.

This app is for people whose finances feel scattered:
- Some numbers in their head  
- Some in their bank app  
- Some they’d rather not look at too closely  

The goal is to break everything down and put it all in one place, so you can see what’s actually happening before stress, guessing, or avoidance takes over.

In other words: *Break down the numbers before they break you down.*

## ✨ How it works
- You can use the dashboard without creating an account 
- All calculations happen locally in your session  
- If you want to save your data and come back later, you can create an account and save it to the database  
- No bank connections, no scraping, no automation, everything is manual and transparent  

This is intentionally calm, simple, and non-judgmental.

# What’s Inside

## 💸 Personal Finance Dashboard

### Monthly Cash Flow
This is the heart of the app.

You itemize:
- Income  
- Fixed expenses  
- Essential variable expenses  
- Non-essential spending  
- Saving & investing  

From there, the dashboard calculates:
- How much you’re actually bringing in  
- How much you’re spending  
- How much is going to debt  
- What’s left over  
- What that leftover looks like weekly and daily  

It turns *“I think this is fine?”* into real numbers you can actually work with.

### Summary
A simple, at-a-glance view of the numbers that matter most.

No digging, no scrolling, just:
- What’s coming in  
- What’s going out  
- What’s already committed  
- What you actually have left  

This section is meant to **ground you**, not overwhelm you.

### 🆘 Emergency Minimum
This section answers the uncomfortable but important question:

**“What would I actually need if income stopped?”**

It estimates a conservative monthly minimum based on:
- Fixed bills  
- Essential variable spending  
- Minimum debt payments  

And shows what that number looks like across 3, 6, and 12 months.

### Net Worth Tracking
This is about clarity, not pressure.

You can list assets and liabilities side-by-side to see the bigger picture:
- Automatic net worth calculation  
- Optional detailed debt tracking (balances, APRs, minimum payments)  

The goal isn’t judgment.  
The goal is **awareness**.

## 🏡 Mortgage Payoff Calculator

A standalone tool for breaking down one of the biggest (and most stressful) numbers most people have.

The Mortgage Payoff Calculator shows:
- Your full amortization schedule  
- Total interest over time  
- How many months you can shave off with extra payments  
- Interest saved by paying a little extra  
- Estimated PMI drop-off  

You can also factor in:
- Taxes  
- Insurance  
- HOA dues  
- PMI  

It doesn’t tell you what you *should* do, it just shows the tradeoffs clearly.

## 💾 Saving Your Data
By default, nothing you enter is saved permanently.

If you choose to create an account:
- You can save your dashboard data to your account  
- Your numbers will load automatically next time  
- Saving only happens when you click “Save my data”

Your data:
- Is tied to your login  
- Is not shared  
- Is never pulled from external accounts
